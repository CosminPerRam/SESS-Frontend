# Source Engine Server Searcher
SESS is an Open Source project that aims to fully recreate the Source
Engine Server Searcher (also named Community Server Browser) from
Valve's Multiplayer Source Games like
[TF2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/),
[Half-Life 2: Deathmatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320/HalfLife_2_Deathmatch/),
[CS:GO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) and
many others.

The project is available over at [sess.online](https://sess.online).
